      <h4>Anaal Nathrakh enter into an age of ‘Endarkenment’ with hectic new song </h4>
      <p> Anaal Nathrakh’s brand of extreme blackened, grinding death metal is as consistent as it thought-provoking and heavy. 
        That was true of ‘A New Kind Of Horror‘ (2018) and the very same is looking to be accurate for their next album, ‘Endarkenment.’ 
        With it’s recently released first single and eponymous cut being the kind of explosive, riff-heavy style the band are highly regarded for.
        With all of multi-instrumentalist Mick Kenney’s noisy guitars and sick blast beats,
        and vocalist Dave Hunt’s huge power-metal refrains sitting in their usual places.</p>
      <p>Like other Anaal Nathrakh albums, there’s many liner notes to accompany the themes and messages of their songs. ‘Endarkenment‘ is no different. 
        With Dave sharing about this forthcoming album and it’s subsequent titular song’s theme of “post-truths,” 
        personal selfishness and political dogma, that: </p>
      <p>There has been, and continues to be, increasingly widespread rejection of Enlightenment-style values such as rationalism, skepticism,
        the rejection of faith in favour of judgements dependent on empirically verifiable phenomena and so on. There are local versions in many places, 
        but in our native UK, this was summed up by politician/sinister gnome Michael Gove’s famous claim that we’ve ‘had enough of experts‘.
        Thus we enter the age of endarkenment.“ </p>

    <p> INTERVIEW WITH DAVE HUNT (V.I.T.R.I.O.L.)</p>
    <p>BY GEORGE PACHECO</p>
    <p>COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARIE KORNER</p>
<p>Intense. There are a number of adjectives one could use to describe Britain’s Anaal Nathrakh, but this one just seems to fit like an iron glove. 
      In fact, there’s been plenty of ink spilt about this duo of vocalist Dave Hunt (V.I.T.R.I.O.L.) and instrumentalist/drum programmer/songwriter Irrumator, 
      also known by the human name of Mick Kenney, from their raw black metal origins to the chaotic and grinding riff machine they are today.</p>
