      <h4>Anaal Nathrakh enter into an age of ‘Endarkenment’ with hectic new song </h4>
      <p> Anaal Nathrakh’s brand of extreme blackened, grinding death metal is as consistent as it thought-provoking and heavy. 
        That was true of ‘A New Kind Of Horror‘ (2018) and the very same is looking to be accurate for their next album, ‘Endarkenment.’ 
        With it’s recently released first single and eponymous cut being the kind of explosive, riff-heavy style the band are highly regarded for.
        With all of multi-instrumentalist Mick Kenney’s noisy guitars and sick blast beats,
        and vocalist Dave Hunt’s huge power-metal refrains sitting in their usual places.</p>
      <p>Like other Anaal Nathrakh albums, there’s many liner notes to accompany the themes and messages of their songs. ‘Endarkenment‘ is no different. 
        With Dave sharing about this forthcoming album and it’s subsequent titular song’s theme of “post-truths,” 
        personal selfishness and political dogma, that: </p>
      <p>There has been, and continues to be, increasingly widespread rejection of Enlightenment-style values such as rationalism, skepticism,
        the rejection of faith in favour of judgements dependent on empirically verifiable phenomena and so on. There are local versions in many places, 
        but in our native UK, this was summed up by politician/sinister gnome Michael Gove’s famous claim that we’ve ‘had enough of experts‘.
        Thus we enter the age of endarkenment.“ </p>

    <p> INTERVIEW WITH DAVE HUNT (V.I.T.R.I.O.L.)</p>
    <p>BY GEORGE PACHECO</p>
    <p>COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARIE KORNER</p>
<p>Intense. There are a number of adjectives one could use to describe Britain’s Anaal Nathrakh, but this one just seems to fit like an iron glove. 
      In fact, there’s been plenty of ink spilt about this duo of vocalist Dave Hunt (V.I.T.R.I.O.L.) and instrumentalist/drum programmer/songwriter Irrumator, 
      also known by the human name of Mick Kenney, from their raw black metal origins to the chaotic and grinding riff machine they are today.</p>

    <p>Anaal Nathrakh have apparently played their final show, which took place at the Scala venue in London last Wednesday (December 14th) with Sigh and De Profundis. </p>
    <p>As noted by Metal Injection, their lineup included Akercocke and Voices members, with guitarist Mick Kenney being absent as the latter has experienced a "change of plan… which meant that his focus had to shift, for the time being at least." </p>
    <p>Once the London show ended, Anaal Nathrakh posted a thank you to everyone in attendance, and within that statement comes the news that they either have an uncertain future or they are just trying to decide what to do next, saying "nothing has been booked or agreed, and we will see what the future brings."
